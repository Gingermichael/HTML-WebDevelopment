            <h2>What is Rent A Dad?</h2><br>
            <p>Our company is a social service platform aimed at giving small children, teens, and young
                adults an opportunity to have positive father figures in their lives. Many families are 
                not perfect, and life can cause a great deal of people to end up without the guidance of a
                dad in their life as a result. Some fathers leave families, others are lost to tragedy, a few 
                develop serious health complications, etc. For these family situations Rent A Dad offers a service
                where people can hire their ideal father figure for brief or extended periods of time.
                If you or someone you know is in need of a father figure that will help guide them, increase
                their overall happiness and quality of life, and be the dad they wish they always had, have them 
                contact Rent A Dad today!

            <h2>How does Rent A Dad work?</h2><br>
            <p>Rent a dad offers contract based services where customers can choose a dad currently available
                on our Hire A Dad page and then customize their contract afterwards. For family placement and 
                integration we offer the following: in home living environments where the dad can live with the 
                family for extended time periods, seperate households where the family can visit and stay with 
                the father, and event based planning where the father attends individual events in the families 
                life. Each contract reserves a specific amount of time (in years) in which the father will be
                working with the family. Contracts can be renewed, modified, or cancelled at any time with no
                extra charges. Services are offered at our starting rate of 20/hour spent with the father with 
                compounding discounts for bulk time reservation (up to 60% off!).
